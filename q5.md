All three codes do the same thing- Starting from 0 print out the even numbers until the range seperated by a colon. For example, if the range was 5 then starting from 0 it would print out even numbers or numbers incremented by 2 till 8 because 8 is the 5th element followed by a colon which is printed at the end of each element.

<b>Approach 1</b>- uses the index i till the range-1 where it multiples the index by 2 and appends it to the list so if index was 3 and range was 5 the steps would be 
range | index | append to the lst
    1 |     0 | 0*2
    2 |     1 | 1*2 = 2 
    3 |     2 | 2*2 = 4
    4 |     3 | 3*2 = 6
    5 |     4 | 4*2 = 8
---------STOP---------
<b>Approach 2</b>- uses list comprehension method, python runs a loop for the given range <pre>for n in range(10)</pre> and then <pre>n*2</pre> means multiply each element n by 2 and finally the <pre>[]</pre> surrounding the whole <pre>[n * 2 for n in range(10)]</pre> means save the elements into a list and outside this statement aka list comprehension then, there is another loop running <pre>for x in [n * 2 for n in range(10)]:</pre> which prints out each element from the list comprehension followed by a colon.


<b> Approach 3</b>- uses generator which is more efficient compare to the previous approaches because it doesn't run the doubleG completely but rather suspends or temporarily stops the doubleG function's execution when it reaches the yield statement. The yield key keyword changes the doubleG function into a generator function. So when its called it returns a generator even though there is no explicit return in the doubleG function. Not all values are computed in the doubleG function. <pre>yield i*2</pre> means that yield values that are i*2 so i is not going to be 0,1,2,3,4.... the for loop will directly return 0,2,4,6,8.... because the generator actually saves the previous value. And as mentioned before, since the function is suspended once the task of priting i in the second loop is done then the generator function continues until the yield is hit again. This function is quite useful for large sequences cus it saves time and resources. I can use this approach for the range of 10,000 where as the previous approached will take time and alot of resource, the previous approaches are not viable for large numbers
